# Contributing to this project

Are you as excited as we are about redefining networking for humanity? If you are the kind of person who enjoys writing new features and new conduits, fixing bugs, writing tests, creating documentation, filling out examples, or helping out in any other way, we would really appreciate the help. Thank-you.

### Contributor Agreement

We at connectFree are trying to make open source work as a business model. One of the ways we're doing that is by offering EVER/IP(R) for sale under more proprietary licensing terms. To do this, connectFree needs to own the copyright to its source. In order to support this business model while also allowing community contributions, we ask that contributors sign a Contributor Assignment Agreement. Before submitting patches, please fill out the CAA for [individuals](http://connectfree.co.jp/ca/individual/) or [companies](http://connectfree.co.jp/ca/entity/). Thank-you to [Harmony Agreements](http://harmonyagreements.org/).

### Face-to-Face
We live, work and play in Kyoto, JAPAN. If you are ever in the area, please let us know and be sure to stop by.

We are always hiring!
