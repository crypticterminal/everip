# EVER/IP(r) Frequently Asked Questions

EVER/IP is a relatively new technology and you might have some questions about it.
Here we aim to provide you with some answers to your questions.

## What is EVER/IP?

EVER/IP is a new way to think about building the Internet. When the Internet was first developed in the 1980s, there was limited computational power to route millions of messages per second. The solution that the godfathers of the Internet introduced was a prefix-based memory-bound routing table design that requires very expensive custom ASIC and memory to operate at scale.

Fast-forward three decades, EVER/IP is the first kind of routing software that does not require memory expensive routing tables, but instead uses the CPU to calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information.

Being entirely local information driven, there is no need for expensive ISPs and Providers, thus reducing the cost of communication for people and things alike.

Thanks in part to the iPhone(r)<sup>(1)</sup> and other smartphones of its generation, the computing power that we have in our pocket is incredible. EVER/IP aims to unleash this power, bringing-down the cost of communications worldwide and beyond. 

Companies like Microsoft helped take us from yesterday's mainframe into the Personal Computer era with "micro-software." We aim to take humanity from today's mainframe (cloud) into the Personal Communications era with Micro Internet eXchanges (MIXes). Welcome to the MicroISPâ„¢ era.

## What makes EVER/IP a unique solution?

1) You own your own IP Address for*ever*. No monthly costs.
2) Your IP Address is authenticated, so that no one can become you.
3) All communications are encrypted, which is very important for banking and infrastructure.
4) Works with existing network technologies (WiFi, Ethernet, Fibre, etc.) so that there is no cost to rebuild networks
5) Existing applications just work: EVER/IP reports itself to the Operating System as a VPN.
6) No need for network administrators: network configuration is instant and autonomous.

While there are other dynamic routing solutions and VPNs that interface with the IPv6 address space, EVER/IP is the only IPv6 solution that can calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information. Other open-source projects such as CJDNS, SAFE Network and IPFS use forms of memory-backed routing tables or route labels to facilitate connectivity.

In contrast, EVER/IP makes routing decisions by calculating differences between connected coordinates in a larger network graph. EVER/IP's low memory footprint gives it the edge in any embedded project or application.

## How is EVER/IP different from traditional Internet routing?

In a traditional networking environment, the address space and subsequently each device's address is divided into networks and subnetworks, involving the designation of network or routing prefixes. Networks are not independant and whole blocks of network addresses can be owned by large companies.

For example, Apple Inc. [owns all IP addresses that start with the number 17][1]. Ford Motor Company [owns all IP addresses that start with the number 19][1]. Each company owns 16,581,375 addresses. There are only 4,294,967,296 ip addresses available on the Internet, which means that these companies own approximately 1/256th of the entire Internet.

In contrast, EVER/IP assigns one IP Address to one device, for the lifetime of the device. The IP Address cannot be revoked later and if the device is destroyed, the IP Address is lost with the device. EVER/IP supports up to 2<sup>120</sup> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576) IP Addresses. This is 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056 times more IP Addresses than what the current Internet supports.

Traditional networking also requires that there be a network integrator to see that all network routes on a network are valid. In contrast, EVER/IP is a completely autonomous system that automatically detects links and routes based on local information. This requires no network integrator to operate and is perfect for network cameras and other appliance devices.
