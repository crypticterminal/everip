# EVER/IP(r) Frequently Asked Questions

EVER/IP is a relatively new technology and you might have some questions about it.
Here we aim to provide you with some answers to your questions.

## What is EVER/IP?

EVER/IP is a new way to think about building the Internet. When the Internet was first developed in the 1980s, there was limited computational power to route millions of messages per second. The solution that the godfathers of the Internet introduced was a prefix-based memory-bound routing table design that requires very expensive custom ASIC and memory to operate at scale.

Fast-forward three decades, EVER/IP is the first kind of routing software that does not require memory expensive routing tables, but instead uses the CPU to calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information.

Being entirely local information driven, there is no need for expensive ISPs and Providers, thus reducing the cost of communication for people and things alike.

Thanks in part to the iPhone(r)<sup>(1)</sup> and other smartphones of its generation, the computing power that we have in our pocket is incredible. EVER/IP aims to unleash this power, bringing-down the cost of communications worldwide and beyond. 

Microsoft helped take us from the mainframe era with micro-software. We aim to take humanity into an era from Internet eXchanges to Micro Internet eXchanges (MIXes). Welcome to the MicroISPâ„¢ era.

## What makes EVER/IP a unique solution?

1) You own your own IP Address for*ever*. No monthly costs.
2) Your IP Address is authenticated, so that no one can become you.
3) All communications are encrypted, which is very important for banking and infrastructure.
4) Works with existing network technologies (WiFi, Ethernet, Fibre, etc.) so that there is no cost to rebuild networks
5) No need for new applications: EVER/IP reports itself to the Operating System as a VPN.

While there are other dynamic routing solutions and VPNs that interface with the IPv6 address space, EVER/IP is the only IPv6 solution that can calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information. Other open-source projects such as CJDNS, SAFE Network and IPFS use forms of memory-backed routing tables to facilitate connectivity.
